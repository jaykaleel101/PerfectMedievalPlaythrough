DONE:
- The Apiary is now fueled from beeswax instead of meat, because meat did not make sense to me
- Honeycomb was labelled honey, which was confusing, because you have to turn it into honey, so I just labelled it honeycomb
- Added straw as ingredient to make kibble, because it just makes sense
- Added straw from wheat harvest as a by-product
- Added straw as a drop from tall grass (instead of hay). (this is for tribal starts to get to straw without nescessarly planting weat)
- Removed hay to straw rack.
- removed hay as product of weat milling.
- VFEM Archery Target is now made from 20 straw and 4 wood (used to be 20 wood)
- Allows apothecary plants to spawn in the dark forest and ancient forest medieval overhaul biomes.
- MO's smelter coal production now gives ahses aswell.
- Adds smokeleaf production to the apothecary table.
- A permanent version of the charcoal kiln is now available
- Charcoal kiln and the bench recipe for charcoal now converts wood to charcoal at 150% efficiency (1 wood log = 1.5 charcoal)
- The kiln and bench recipe now use MO wood types
- Recipes that use Apothecary's tallow now use MO's tallow
- Dried Meat is now a storage option for raw meat: ratio is 75:75 when drying meat (opposed to 100:9)
nutrition value is lowered from 0.7 to 0.05(similar to raw meat) so it can be used as an ingredient when cooking.
Smoked Meat stayed the same, as it is an edible meal/snack.
On some duplicate stuff, I decided to keep one:
- The MO Smoker is replaced by the VFEM smoker to make Smoked Meat and Smoked Fish
- All Apothecary salt is now MO salt
- All Apothecary tallow is now MO tallow - recipe to make tallow from meat is removed
- Wine production of medieval overhaul will now have quality added, similar to VFEM wine quality.
- Apothecary and vanilla stove and smithy are removed, all bills can be found under the MO counterparts. Again to declutter the amount of benches with almost similar uses.
- Apothecary charcoal can be used in MO appliances that use fuel, and while I was at it, timber is removed as fuel (raw wood, coal and tar stayed).
- MO Garlic is renamed to shallot, so it is not to be confused with Apothecary garlic

Some extras inspired by Vanilla cooking and plants expanded:
- Ale now adds an extra work speed buff
- Garlic, shallot and onion are resistent to blight - so they can be used to plant between other crops (4tiles wide) to prevent blight spreading.
- More to be added

TODO:
Beer de-duping is in progress (two worts and processors)
