Medieval overhaul changes:
- The Apiary is now fueled with beeswax instead of meat

- Added MO straw as ingredient to make kibble

- Removed hay to straw rack.
- removed hay as by-product of weat milling.
- Dried Meat is now a storage option for raw meat: ratio is 75:75 when drying meat (opposed to 100:9)
nutrition value is lowered from 0.7 to 0.05(similar to raw meat) so it can be used as an ingredient when cooking. Smoked Meat stayed the same, as it is an edible meal/snack.
- The furnace can only be fueld with coal and charcoal (wood burning does not reach the heat needed to smelt metals)
- Added quality to Wine production of medieval overhaul.
- A queen bee is now a regular queen bee
- beeswax versions of candles needs to be refuelled less often vs the tallow versions

- Recipe for ale wort is changed into 20xwheat and 5xspices
- in all starting scenarios that used to scatter around timber it is now replaced with wood 
- tweaked stew recipes, the new basically include meat with onion and meat with onion and beer 
- MO Garlic is renamed to beet, so it is not to be confused with Apothecary garlic. Beet will later be expanded upon: it will survive winters and can be used as an alternative to sugar cane in cold climates.
